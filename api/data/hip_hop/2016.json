Well, I ain't  And I didn't wanna write a song 'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care. I don't But you still hit my phone up And, baby, I'll be movin' on And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back Maybe you should know that  My mama don't like you and she likes everyone And I never like to admit that I was wrong And I've been so caught up in my job Didn't see what's going on But now I know I'm better sleeping on my own  'Cause if you like the way you look that much Oh, baby, you should go and love yourself And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin' You should go and love yourself  But when you told me that you hated my friends The only problem was with you and not them And every time you told me my opinion was wrong And tried to make me forget where I came from  And I didn't wanna write a song 'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care. I don't But you still hit my phone up And, baby, I'll be movin' on And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back Maybe you should know that  My mama don't like you and she likes everyone And I never like to admit that I was wrong And I've been so caught up in my job Didn't see what's going on But now I know I'm better sleeping on my own  'Cause if you like the way you look that much Oh, baby, you should go and love yourself And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin' You should go and love yourself  For all the times that you made me feel small I fell in love. Now I feel nothin' at all I never felt so low and I was vulnerable Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?  'Cause if you like the way you look that much Oh, baby, you should go and love yourself And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin' You should go and love yourself  'Cause if you like the way you look that much Oh, baby, you should go and love yourself And if you think (you think) that I'm (that I'm) still holdin' on (holdin' on) to somethin' You should go and love yourself"
